# Mysh

Inspired by the excellent article "Writing a Shell in 25 Lines of Ruby Code"
found at (http://www.blackbytes.info/2016/07/writing-a-shell-in-ruby/) I
thought it would be fun to experiment with that concept and see if it could
be taken further.

Many years ago, a popular shell program was modeled after
the 'C' programming language. It went by the csh for C-shell (by the C shore :-)
Instead of 'C', my shell would be based on Ruby (were you shocked?)!  The
obvious name rsh for Ruby-shell was already in use by the Remote-shell. So,
given the limited scope of this effort, and not wanting to do a lot of typing
all the time, I chose the name mysh for My-shell.

It would seem that no one has programmed a shell program at this level of
narcissism until now as that name was available.

The mysh is available as both a stand-alone CLI program and for use as a
command shell within Ruby applications and Rails web sites.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'mysh'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install mysh

## Contributing

#### Plan A

1. Fork it ( https://github.com/PeterCamilleri/mysh/fork )
2. Switch to the development branch ('git branch development')
3. Create your feature branch ('git checkout -b my-new-feature')
4. Commit your changes ('git commit -am "Add some feature"')
5. Push to the branch ('git push origin my-new-feature')
6. Create new Pull Request

#### Plan B

Go to the GitHub repository at (https://github.com/PeterCamilleri/mysh) and
raise an issue calling attention to some aspect that could use some TLC or a
suggestion or an idea.
