mysh (MY ruby SHell) version: {{ Mysh::VERSION }}


In mysh, commands fall into one of three broad categories. There are:

1) Ruby expressions:

Any line beginning with an equals "=" sign will be evaluated as a Ruby
expression. This allows the mysh command line to serve as a programming,
debugging and super-calculator environment.

For more information on ruby expressions use the 'help =' command.

Note: This environment includes support for advanced mathematical operations.
      For more information on this feature, use the 'help math' command.

2) Internal mysh commands:

Internal commands are processed within mysh itself. Any command that matches
the name of an internal command is processed internally by mysh.

The following set of commands are supported:

{{ format_items(InternalCommand.command_info).join("\n") }}

3) External commands:

All other commands are executed by the system using the standard shell or the
appropriate ruby interpreter.

If the command has a '.rb' extension, it is executed by the appropriate ruby
interpreter. So the command "myfile.rb" is executed as

  {{ RbConfig.ruby }} myfile.rb"

Note: If an internal command has the same name as an external command, adding a
      leading space will force the use of the external command.
