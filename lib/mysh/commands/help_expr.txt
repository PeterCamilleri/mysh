mysh Ruby expression support summary:

All command lines that begin with an equals ("=") sign are evaluated as Ruby
expressions. Lines ending with a backslash character ("\") are continued on the
next line. The prompt changes to "mysh\" to indicate that this is going on. The
command is NOT actually processed until a line with NO trailing backslash is
entered.

The results of the expression are displayed using the pretty-print facility.

Note: Auto-complete always places any file names in quotes so they can be used
      as string parameters.

A few noteworthy special methods exist:

=reset      Reset the execution environment to the default state.
=result     Returns the result of the previous expression.
=vls "mask" List modules with version info. The optional mask string value is
            used to filter for modules containing that string.
