mysh (MY ruby SHell) version: {{ Mysh::VERSION }}

In mysh, commands fall into one of three broad categories. There are:

1) Ruby expressions:

- Any line beginning with an equals "=" sign will be evaluated as a Ruby
  expression. This allows the mysh command line to serve as a programming,
  debugging and super-calculator environment.
- For more information on ruby expressions use the 'help ruby' command.

- This environment includes support for advanced mathematical operations.
- For more information on this feature, use the 'help math' command.

2) Internal mysh commands:

- Internal commands are recognized by name and are executed by mysh directly.
- These commands are found in the ".../mysh/lib/mysh/commands" folder.
- The following set of commands are supported:

{{ format_items(InternalCommand.command_info).join("\n") }}

3) External commands:

- All other commands are executed by the system using the standard shell or
  the appropriate ruby interpreter.
- If an internal command has the same name as an external command, adding a
  leading space will force the use of the external command.
- If the command has a '.rb' extension, it is executed by the appropriate ruby
  interpreter. So the command "myfile.rb" is executed as

  {{ RbConfig.ruby }} myfile.rb"

  for this particular system.
