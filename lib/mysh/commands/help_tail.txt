3) External commands:

- All other commands are executed by the system using the standard shell or
  the appropriate ruby interpreter.
- If an internal command has the same name as an external command, adding a
  leading space will force the use of the external command.
- If the command has a '.rb' extension, it is executed by the appropriate ruby
  interpreter. So the command "myfile.rb" is executed as
  "C:/RailsInstaller/Ruby2.1.0/bin/ruby.exe myfile.rb"
