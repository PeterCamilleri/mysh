2) Ruby Expression support:

- Any line beginning with an equals "=" sign will be evaluated as a Ruby
  expression. This allows the mysh command line to serve as a programming,
  debugging and super-calculator environment.
- For more info use the 'help ruby' command.

3) Math support:

- The execution environment includes the Math module.
- For more info use the 'help math' command.

4) External commands:

- Executed by the system using the standard shell.
- To force the use of the external shell, add a leading space to the command.

Note: If the command has a '.rb' extension it is executed by Ruby.
      So the command "myfile.rb" is executed as "ruby myfile.rb"
