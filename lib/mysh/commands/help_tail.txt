2) Ruby Expression support:
 - any line beginning with an equals "=" sign will be evaluated as a Ruby
   expression. This allows the mysh command line to serve as a programming,
   debugging and super-calculator environment.
 - for more info use the 'help ruby' command.

3) Math support:
 - the execution environment includes the Math module.
 - for more info use the 'help math' command.

4) External commands:"
 - executed by the system using the standard shell.
 - to force the use of the external shell, add a leading space to the command.

Note: If the command has a '.rb' extension it is executed by Ruby.
      So the command "myfile.rb" is executed as "ruby myfile.rb"
