mysh Ruby expression support summary

 - All command lines that begin with an equals "=" sign are evaluated as Ruby
   expressions.
 - The results are displayed using the pretty-print facility.
 - The results are also stored in the pseudo-variable result. This allows
   previous results to be used in the next next expression.
