mysh Ruby expression support summary

 - All command lines that begin with an equals "=" sign are evaluated as Ruby
   expressions.
 - Expressions ending with a backslash character "\" are continued on the next
   line. The prompt changes to "mysh\" to indicate that this is going on.
 - The results are displayed using the pretty-print facility.
 - Auto-complete always places any file names in quotes so they can be used
   as string parameters.

A few noteworthy methods exist that facilitate use of Ruby expressions:

reset      Reset the execution environment to the default state.
result     Returns the result of the previous expression.
vls <mask> List modules with version info. The optional mask string value
           is used to filter for modules containing that string.
