Help: mysh type command summary:

The type command is used to display one or more text files. The names of these
files are the arguments to this command as are options that control how those
files are processed before being displayed.

Files can be handled in one of two modes:

    raw    Files are displayed with no pre-processing
    cooked Files are displayed after handlebars and shell variables have been
           processed and the results inserted into the text.

The default behavior of the type command is set by the \$type variable. This
may take the values:

    raw, off, false, no   = raw mode (the default value)
    cooked, on, true, yes = cooked mode

Within the type command, options can be used to override the defaults:

    +c  Force cooked mode.
    -c  Force raw mode.

Note: This command contrasts with the load command which can also be used to
      display text files. The difference is the the load command always expands
      handlebars and shell variables.
