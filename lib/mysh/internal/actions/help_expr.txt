mysh Ruby expression support summary:

All command lines that begin with = are evaluated as Ruby expressions.

Notes:

Lines ending with a \\ are continued on the next line. The prompt changes to
mysh\\ to indicate that this is going on. The command is NOT actually processed
until a line with NO trailing \\ is entered.

The results of the expression are displayed using the pretty-print facility
except for nil (shows as blank).

Auto-complete always places any file names in quotes so they can be used as
string parameters.

A few special methods exist:

=reset      Reset the execution environment to the default state.
=result     Returns the result of the previous expression.
=x.lineage  Get the class lineage of the object x.
=vls "mask" List modules with version info. The optional mask string value is
            used to filter for modules containing that string.

Also included are a number of math methods. See '? math' for more on these.
