Help: mysh supported file types.

The mysh shell has direct support for three types of external files. These are 
mysh shell scripts, Ruby source files, and augmented text files

1) The mysh shell scripts are identified by the ".mysh" file suffix. These
   files contain mysh commands and are interpreted as if typed at the command 
   prompt by the user.

2) The Ruby source files are just that, Ruby code that is loaded into mysh and
   executed in the mysh context. These have access to the full power of the
   Ruby Language system.

3) The augmented text files are simple text files augmented with support for
   mysh shell variables ($$var) and embedded code {\{ Ruby code goes here }}

This help file is an example of an augmented text file.
