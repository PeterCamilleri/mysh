Help: mysh variables:

In mysh, variables are kept that control the behavior of the shell. This simple
command is used to set, delete, and display these variables. The basic method
for setting a variable is:

    $name=value

Where:
* name is a word matching the regex: /[a-z][a-z0-9_]*/. Lower case only.
* value is a string, with embedded variables and handlebars.

To erase the value of a variable, use:         $$name=
To display the name/value of a variable, use:  $$name
To display all variable names/values use:      $$

As an escapement, the string $$$$ maps to a single $$.

Some variables that are used in mysh are:

$$d           The current date.
$$date_fmt    The format for the date: "%Y-%m-%d"
$$debug       Does the shell display additional debugging info (true/false)
$$h           The home folder's path
$$post_prompt The prompt used when a line is continued with a trailing \\
             character.
$$pre_prompt  A prompt string displayed before the actual command prompt.
             Delete the pre_prompt variable to disable pre-prompting.
$$prompt      The user prompt.
$$t           The current time.
$$time_fmt    The format for the time: "%H:%M"
$$u           The current user.
$$w           The current working directory's path.
