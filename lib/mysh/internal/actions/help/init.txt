Help: mysh initialization summary:

When mysh starts up, it must be initialized and acclimated to its environment. 
The boot/initialization process of mysh is somewhat modeled after that of the 
famous bash shell. On startup:

1 Option values are initialized to their initial, default values.

2 Process pre-boot command line options: Some command line options are
  processed early. These are --help, -h, -?, --init, -i, --no-init, and -ni.
  See Usage above for details on these.

3 Try to load and execute the mysh_init file. There are three possible files
  for this role. In priority order they are

    ~/mysh_init.mysh,
    ~/mysh_init.rb,
    ~/mysh_init.txt.

  NOTE: If an init file is specified with the --init option, or disabled with
        the --no-init option, then this step is skipped.

4 The rest of the command line options are processed at this time. 

It should be noted that in the event of a conflict in settings during the boot
process, the last command/option encountered shall prevail. For example if
the ~/mysh_init.mysh contains the line:

\$debug = true

and the command line has the -nd option, then debug mode will be disabled
because the -nd command line option is processed after the mysh_init file.
