Help: mysh quick commands summary:

In mysh, some commands are identified by a single character, making them easy
and quick to enter. Since these commands are always a single character long,
it is not necessary (but still acceptable) to place a space between the command
and any parameter.

To be processed as quick, the character must be first in the line.

The supported quick commands are:
