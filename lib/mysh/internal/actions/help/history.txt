Help: mysh history command summary:

The history (or !) command is used to allow the user greater control over the
history of commands that have been entered. The action taken by the history
command is controlled by an optional parameter.

If the longer form, show is used, a space is required before the parameter. If
the quick form, ! is used, the space is optional.

Quick    Long            Command
Form     Form            Description
=====    =======         ===========
!        history         Display the entire history buffer.

!index   history index   Retrieve history entry number index and present this
                         to the user as the next command.

!clear   history clear   Clear the command history.

!pattern history pattern Display the part of the history buffer containing the
                         regex pattern. Note: This pattern cannot be 'clear'
                         so use 'clea[r]' instead.

The history buffer is controlled by two variables:

$$history  Is the history buffer enabled?
$$no_move  Are history entries kept in place or shifted up the buffer?

These are also controlled by command line options. See ?usage for more info.
