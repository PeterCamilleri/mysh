Help: mysh show gem command summary:

The show gem (or @gem) command is used to display useful information about
the current gem system. There are two distinct ways to use this command.

The first is without any arguments. This displays general information about the
gem subsystem. This includes:

about         - About rubygems.
version       - The current version of rubygems.
latest        - The latest version of rubygems available.
marshal       - The version of the marshal format for your ruby.
host          - Get the default RubyGems API host.
                This is normally https://rubygems.org.
sources       - Returns an Array of sources to fetch remote gems from.
gem folder    - The path where gems are to be installed.
bin folder    - The path where gem executables are to be installed.
config path   - The path to standard location of the user's .gemrc file.
cert path     - The default signing certificate chain path
key path      - The default signing key path
spec cache    - The path to where specs are cached.
file suffixes - Suffixes for require-able paths.
gem dep files - The files where dependencies may be specified. Use Gemfile
gem platforms - Array of platforms this RubyGems supports.
gem path      - The folders searched when looking for a gem locally.

The alternative is to specify a list of gems of interest. For each gem in the
list, the program will list all installed versions of that gem and the latest
version of that gem on the rubygems host. For example:

    8 mysh>@gem rails gosu
    Info on specified gems.

    rails  4.2.0, 5.1.3, 5.1.6
    latest 5.2.2

    gosu   0.13.3
    latest 0.14.4
