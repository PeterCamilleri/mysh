Help: mysh version: {{ Mysh::VERSION }}

The mysh is a shell program inspired by the Ruby programming language in the
same way the csh was inspired by the "C" programming language.

In mysh, commands fall into one of three broad categories. There are:

1) "=" expressions: Any line beginning with an "=" will be evaluated as a Ruby
   language expression. For more see the '?=' or '?math' commands.

2) Internal mysh commands are processed within mysh itself. The following set
   of commands are supported:

{{ Mysh::COMMANDS.actions_info.mysh_bulletize.join("\n") }}

3) All other commands are executed by the system using the standard shell or
   the appropriate ruby interpreter. If the command has a '.rb' extension, it
   is executed by the appropriate ruby interpreter. So the command "myfile.rb"
   is executed as:

   "{{ RbConfig.ruby }} myfile.rb"

Note: If an internal command has the same name as an external command, adding a
      leading space will force the use of the external command.
